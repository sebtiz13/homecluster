## BIOS setup

> You need to do it once per machine if the default config is not sufficient.

Common settings:

- Use UEFI mode and disable CSM (legacy) mode
- Disable secure boot

## Gather information

- Choose a static IP address for each machine (just the desired address, we don't set anything up yet)
- OS disk name want used for ZFS pool (for example `/dev/sda`)
- SSH root password

## Fill data

1. Duplicate files from `ansible/inventories/prod/host_vars/*.yaml.tpl` and remove the `.tpl` extension
2. Fill the data inside each files

   - You can add `k3s_domain` for customize specific host for kubernetes
