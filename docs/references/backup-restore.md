Full error :

```log
error: unexpected termination of replication stream

barman.command_wrappers INFO: main_backup: pg_receivewal: starting log streaming at 0/2D000000 (timeline 1)
barman.command_wrappers INFO: main_backup: pg_receivewal: error: unexpected termination of replication stream: ERROR:  requested WAL segment 00000001000000000000002D has already been removed
barman.command_wrappers INFO: main_backup: pg_receivewal: error: disconnected
```

If this error is thrown, you need to run the following command `barman receive-wal main_backup --reset`.
